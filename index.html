<h1>Heyo</h1>
  <p>The website is https://czaplicki-j.github.io/ </p>
  <p>Make a GitHub Account and I'll add you as a contributer. </p>
  <p>There are 4 branches that have your name. Use them to upload your code. They're a safety net just in case the code is bad.</p>
  <p>Download an editor for html. Name the html file as index.html and upload it to github when finished. This is the file that changes the front screen</p>
  <p> You could use the GitHub website or download the GitHub Desktop lab. Ask me if y'all have any questions</p>
