<h1>How does Powerball Work?</h1>
<h2>Quick Facts</h2>
<p>The Jackpot starts at $40 Million </p>
<p>If the Jackpot is not awarded, it rises by at least $10 million</p>
<p>PowerBall consists of 5 white balls and one red ball called the powerball. The jackpot is awarded when all 6 numbers are matched. Even if at only one number is matched, a prize is still awarded. The order of the numbers do not matter. A 67 15 66 20 8 5 is equivalent to a 67 8 20 66 15 5 </p>
<p>The PowerBall is not influenced by how many tickets are bought. The probaiblity is fixed as there are 69 white balls and 26 red balls. </p>
<p>For an extra dollar, Power Play may be added. This uses a randomly generated number from 2-5 and acts as a multiplier to the payout aside from the jackpot. If the jackpot is worth less than $150 million, a 10x multiplayer is used.</p>
<p>The prizes are: </p>
<p>Powerball only: $4</p>
<p>1 White Ball + PowerBall: $4</p>
<p>2 White Balls + PowerBall: $7</p>
<p>3 White Balls: $7</p>
<p>3 White Balls + PowerBall: $100</p>
<p>4 White Balls: $100</p>
<p>4 White Balls + PowerBall: $50,000</p>
<p>5 White Balls: $1,000,000</p>
<p>5 White Balls + PowerBall: Jackpot</p>
