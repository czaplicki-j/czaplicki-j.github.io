<h1>How Does Powerball Work?</h1>
<p>A PowerBall ticket costs $2 and $3 with the Power Play option.</p>
<p>Drawings are held on Wednesdays and Saturdays</p>
<p>The Jackpot starts at $40 Million. </p>
<p>If the Jackpot is not awarded, it rises by at least $10 million.</p>
<p>PowerBall consists of 5 white balls and one red ball called the powerball. The jackpot is awarded when all 6 numbers are matched. Even if only one number is matched, a prize is still awarded. The order of the numbers do not matter. A 67 15 66 20 8 5 is equivalent to a 67 8 20 66 15 5.</p>
<p>The PowerBall is not influenced by how many tickets are bought. The probaiblity is fixed as there are 69 white balls and 26 red balls. </p>
<p>For an extra dollar, Power Play may be added. This uses a randomly generated number from 2-5 and acts as a multiplier to the payout aside from the jackpot. If the jackpot is worth less than $150 million, a 10x multiplier is used.</p>
<h1>Prizes</h1>
<p>PowerBall only: $4</p>
<p>1 White Ball + PowerBall: $4</p>
<p>2 White Balls + PowerBall: $7</p>
<p>3 White Balls: $7</p>
<p>3 White Balls + PowerBall: $100</p>
<p>4 White Balls: $100</p>
<p>4 White Balls + PowerBall: $50,000</p>
<p>5 White Balls: $1,000,000</p>
<p>5 White Balls + PowerBall: Jackpot</p>
<h1>Odds of Winning</h1>
<h2>There are 11,238,513 Possible Combinations Of 5 White Balls</h2>
<h2>Multiplied by 26 Red Ball combinations, there are 292,201,338 possible combinations!</h2>
<p>Probability of getting a red Power Ball number correct: 1/26 = .0384 = 38.4%</p>
<p>Probability of getting a single white ball + a red ball:</p>
<p> # of ways of 1 white ball matching 5 white balls: 5!/1!(5-1)! = 5</p>
<p> # of ways of not matching the other 4 white balls: 64!/4!(64-1)! = 635,376</p>
<p>635,376*5 = 3,176,880</p>
<p>3,176,880/292,201,338 = .01087 or 1.087% chance</p>
<p>Probalitiy grows much lower with every additional correct ball</p>
<h1>Guaranteed Jackpot?</h1>
<p>Using $2 tickets, $584,402,676 is required to buy each combination</p>
<p>Highest PowerBall Jackpot: $1.586 billion</p>
<p>It could be profitable, but hope that the jackpot isn't divided</p>
<h1>Is It Worth buying a ticket?</h1>
<p>The probaibilty of having 5 correct white balls and the correct powerball is 1/292,201,338 or 0.00000034222%</p>
<p>If a line of baseballs (2.9in diameter) were lined up from Boston to Los Angeles(2,998.68 highway miles), it would take 65,515,988 baseballs</p>
<p>The probability of driving along this line and picking up a "winner" baseball at random is 1/65,515,988 or 0.000001526%</p>
<h2>You are 4.46x more likely to pick the "winner" baseball along the highway than winning a powerball jackpot!</h2>
