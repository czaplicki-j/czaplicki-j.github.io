Welcome to the website for our discrete structures project!

Use this guide to get started with GitHub: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

There are 3 branches with our names. Use the branch with your name on it to post code, then upload to the master branch. Don't post directly to the master, it's like a safety net for when the code is bad.
